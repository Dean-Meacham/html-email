# html-email
Reflection
In your repo, create a file called README.md and include some thoughts on the following questions:

Why is coding HTML for Email different from web coding?
  HTML for Email is different from web coding because email servers haven't been as refined as web servers to handle
  the newer methods for styling. Usually an email is condensed down into one HTML doc and that's it.
What concepts help coders work around the limitations of HTML in Emails?
  Coders use HTML Table to design the layout of their emails as opposed to other methods such as flexbox or CSS grid.
